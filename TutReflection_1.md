# Tutorial Reflections
_Jan 28, 2016_

I started off the semester rather resistent to Markdown and the whole Markdown experience. However, I have to say that last weekend while I was completing the [__Programming Historian__](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) tutorial for Markdown and Pandoc I began to warm up to it a little more.

My initial hesitations towards Markdown was that I felt that I was severely limited with the kinds of formatting customization that it allows. The problem was that I was continuing to think about it as a replacement for HTML coding rather than a replacement for Notepad. Markdown isn't intended to replace HTML coding. If it were then yes, it does have a lot of limitations. I was caught up in the idea of creating a _blog_ to discuss my progress and work in this class and when I think of "blog" I tend to think pretty (see [here](http://thingstalk.wordpress.com) and [here](http://rhymeswithfloral.github.io)). 

If you compare it to Notepad than there are infinitely more things that can be done with Markdown than with Notepad. Notepade has __ZERO__ formatting options, and creates messy files that aren't easily exported or altered. Listening to other, in class, discuss Markdown like this helped me to change my point of view. I will definitely be switching to Markdown for my basic note-taking program. Simple and quick updates to my work will be way easier with it.
