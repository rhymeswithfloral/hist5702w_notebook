# Tutorial Reflections
_Jan 28, 2016_

I started off the semester rather resistent to Markdown and the whole Markdown experience. However, I have to say that last weekend while I was completing the [__Programming Historian__](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) tutorial for Markdown and Pandoc I began to warm up to it a little more.

My initial hesitations towards Markdown was that I felt that I was severely limited with the kinds of formatting customization that it allows. The problem was that I was continuing to think about it as a replacement for HTML coding rather than a replacement for Notepad. Markdown isn't intended to replace HTML coding. If it were then yes, it does have a lot of limitations. I was caught up in the idea of creating a _blog_ to discuss my progress and work in this class and when I think of "blog" I tend to think pretty (see [here](http://thingstalk.wordpress.com) and [here](http://rhymeswithfloral.github.io)). 

If you compare it to Notepad than there are infinitely more things that can be done with Markdown than with Notepad. Notepade has __ZERO__ formatting options, and creates messy files that aren't easily exported or altered. Listening to other, in class, discuss Markdown like this helped me to change my point of view. I will definitely be switching to Markdown for my basic note-taking program. Simple and quick updates to my work will be way easier with it.

The class discussion about note-taking and open notebooks led to the topic of making our research process visible. With the _traditional_ methods of note-taking our notes are only ever seen by ourselves. The doodles and chicken-scratch aren't thought of as being valuable for anyone but ourselves, let alone being decipherable to any but ourselves. However, more and more the value of visibility and open-access during the research process has been increasingly discussed in various academic fields. 

The concious decision to make one's research notes or project progress open and accessible to the public will tint the notes and progress which we make available. A few of my peers raised some interesting points about this. Being aware of that our work is visible to public could result in tailoring our progress update or research notes for the public. We subconciously or conciously choose certain pictures or information to present because of this; we edit and proof our wording, sentence structure, and voice because of this. We are making decisions about what to say and how to say it with the specific intention of creating a certain point of view or understanding of our work. Is that truly open access?
