# A Semester of Musings

### On Accuracy...

I would not have thought this to be the case, that while doing "digital history" I would spend more time hung up on the accuracy, accumulating information and filling holes than when I did "traditional history." But this has been the case and when I reflect on the little bit of digital history I did last year, it was the same then. Perhaps it is because due to the nature of doing "digital history," the holes in our research are more apparent. Yet, I spent weeks stressing over the fact that I couldn't collect more exact dates and that some of my data was very vague about whether or not Hopkins had actually travelled to a certain. For some reason, it felt unacceptable to include data from a vague or uncertain source, as compared to with using such sources in "traditional history." 

My reaction was that I must have missed something because this is the internet we're talking about; it's not that it isn't there, it's that I didn't find it yet. So I searched relentlessly for something that I could add to my spreadsheet to fill the holes that gaped at me. And since this is the internet we're talking about, there is an endless stream of resources and information to come through and an endless stream of tools to do it with. I was trying to drag a lake with a string. It wasn't until my supervisor pointed out this difference between doing history "digitally" and doing history "traditionally," that I sat back and breathed. 

Digitally or traditionally, there will always be holes in your data, I can't allow myself to to be tricked by the accessibility of information in digital history into thinking that I can fill the holes.

### On Writing Tutorials...

The frustration of writing tutorials while still learning to do things yourself is all the back-tracking and "do overs" that occur as you discover easier and more straightforward ways of accomplishing a task. I have cleaned the same file four different ways, each time was faster than the last. Who did I benefit by doing this? Not me. Though I'm proud of the fact that I've clearly been able to hone my skill, I'm frustrated by this itch I've wanted to scratch all semester, the itch to do something more with these new found skills.

### On Community...

The best tutorials for beginners are by those who are still beginners themselves. Being a novice and entering the world of digital history or digital humanities would have been daunting without a community of other beginnners. HIST5702w is evidence that when you are starting out in digital history, the experience of learning and teaching one another speeds up a process that would take more than 3 months. "There are many ways to skin a cat" and this makes digital history a tricky thing to learn and teach, and there is always a level of uncertainty. Peers help to elleviate that uncertainy as I've seen throughout the semester; unknown errors are resolved through collective problem solving.

I have gone from never having heard of Twine, to being fairly well-versed in Harlowe coding, I'm excited to try my hand at making a text-based game with twine. But I only managed to learn all this because of being able to play around with and test out codes and setups that others had created and discussed in the Twine forum. Personally, I believe that after you learn the basics, Digital history is learned best by playing around with tools and data that have been created by others. Using someone else's code as a template, running your data through someone else's program, using your tool on someone else's data. This is what GitHub is all about and this is what I love about GitHub. If you combined the words "community" and "innovation," it would spell "GitHub."

Fork it 'til you make it.
